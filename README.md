# rUBIKS_sOLvER
solve a Rubiks cube by using different graph algorithm

## Introduction
Welcome to RubiksCubeSolver! This project aims to solve a Rubik's cube quickly using multiple graph algorithms. Throughout this project, we explored various techniques to model and solve the Rubik's cube problem efficiently.

## What We Learned

### Modeling and Problem Breakdown
- *Modeling Real-World Objects:* We learned how to take a real-world object, like a Rubik’s Cube, and model it into something that the computer can understand.
- *Problem Decomposition:* We tackled the complete Rubik’s Cube solver by breaking it down into smaller problems using basic models and controllers, specifically Rubik’s cube representations and solvers.

### Object-Oriented Programming
- *Class Design:* We broke down multiple representations into classes and created base classes that can be further extended, such as the Rubik’s Cube base class and the Pattern Database Base class.
- *OOP Principles:* We implemented practical examples of Object-Oriented Programming, including:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
  - Inheritance
  - Operator Overloading

### Path Finding Algorithms
- *Graph Algorithms:* We explored how path finding algorithms like BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and IDA* can be applied to solve real-world AI problems. These algorithms are not only effective for Rubik’s Cube solving but also for various other AI challenges.
- *Heuristic Search:* We delved into heuristic search algorithms like A* and IDA* and learned how to create Pattern Databases to provide effective heuristics.

### Additional Learnings
- *Custom Data Structures:* We learned how unordered_map<> works for custom objects and how to create custom hash functions.
- *Bit Manipulation:* We explored how bits can be used to store information efficiently.
- *File Handling:* We implemented techniques to save and load files.
- *Black Boxing:* We understood the concept of Black boxing, where an input can be given to a system (e.g., the Permutation Indexer) to get a specific output.
